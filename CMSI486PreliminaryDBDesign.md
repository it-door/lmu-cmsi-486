## 1.0 Introduction
"Ecoins" are a loyalty point system for LMU's Esports Club. We will be designing a database where we can keep track of our members and their participation in the club with the following:

  - Student [Member] entities with emails and grade levels
  - Events and competitions that take place for or between members
  - "Ecoin" values to said events and competitions
  - A member's "ecoin" balance, based on which events they participated in

## 1.1 Project Description

database engine used, potential users, maybe some other stuff
#### 1.1.01 Database Engine
We are considering using a ______ database for this project, as it will _____
#### 1.1.02 Potential Users
The main goal of this database is to allow Esports members to access their "ecoin" balance, but it will also be useful for Esports administrators to access members' emails and grade levels in order to keep an active mailing list and organize school-wide competitions and events.
#### 1.1.03 Interface Options
We will probably be developing a simple web-based front-end on the Esports Club's website, https://lmuesports.com/. Here, members will be able to search up their ecoins balance or provide updated balances (requires confirmation by an administrator). Members will access their balance by providing their email address.
